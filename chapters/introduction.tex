\chapter{Introduction}

% big bang
% heavy ion collisions
% results from former LHC runs
% limitation in intensity due to the danger of magnet quenching
% lhc collimation system is a three stage system to shield the protons from the superconducting LHC magnets
% heavy ion runs: no proper simulation code which respects the break up of heavy ions in the collimators and their ensuing travel in the LHC 

\begin{itemize}
\item LHC breaking many superlatives, e.g. stored beam energy
\item Contrary to the stored beam energy very sensitive hardware, operated closely to quench limit (1K is sufficient to bring to the normal conducting state)
\item Collimation system must protect sensitive devices by inducing controlled losses in dedicated devices.
\item Heavy ion collisions for the generation of QGP
\end{itemize}
